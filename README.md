# ucl-example
this is an example for a workshop for github fundamentals.

## Generic Workflow

clone the repo:

```
git clone <url link to git repo>
```

navigate to the repo. You can then check the status using:

```
git status
```

To create a branch use the following:

```
git checkout -b <branch name>
```

Work on your code as you would. When ready check your 
changes using:

```
git status
```
If they are the changes you like, add them:

```
git add -A
```
Then commit them with a message:

```
git commit -m "<add you message here>"
```

then push to the github repo:

```
git push origin <branch name>
```
